/**
 * HACK: <rdar://problem/65687333> Tech Debt: Metrics: Adam ID attribution should be explicit
 * This is an incremental step out of a hack that used `targetId` as `adamId` for decorating adamId-related fields for a given `MetricsData`.
 * It should be leveraged for paths that use field providers that have an adam id dependency.
 *
 * As of 2022E we are using this key in the `custom` field of `actionMetrics`, which is a recommended method of sending down
 * additional data to augment metrics events but shouldn't be included in the event itself. `custom` fields are automatically
 * added to the `MetricsFieldsContext` by `ActionDispatcher`, allowing `MetricsFieldsProvider`s to access and use this value.
